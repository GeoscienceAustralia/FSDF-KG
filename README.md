# FSDF Ontology
An ontology describing the data class-level relationships between Semantic Web versions of FSDF datasets.

This ontology is an 'upper ontology' in that it serves as a high-level model for other Semantic Web-modelled datasets to map 'up' to. This is so that there is a path for testing interoperability between future FSDF Semantic Web datasets.


## Repository contents
This repository contains:

* [fsdf.ttl](fsdf.ttl) - the technical ontology file
* [fsdf.html](fsdf.html) - the HTML web page version of the technical ontology
* [examples/](examples/) - examples of how the ontology relates FSDF datasets
* [docs/](docs/) - supporting documentation such as product guides to Semantic Web versions of the datasets the FSDF-O relates


## How to get started
***If you are a modeller***:  
Use [fsdf.ttl](fsdf.ttl), the technical ontology file, in an ontology editor such as [Protégé](http://protege.stanford.edu/).

***If you know what an ontology is but don't know what the FSDF-O can do***:  
See the [examples/](examples/) folder with descriptions of how the ontology works, its relationship to systems like [LINK](https://link.fsdf.org.au) and how it relates FSDF datasets.

***If you just want to see how Semantic Web versions of FSDF datasets are related***:  
See [fsdf.html](fsdf.html), the HTML web page version of the technical ontology.

***If you don't know what an ontology is***:
